"""Database interface for accessing and retrieving WhatsApp chat, message, and call data.


This module defines the `Database` class, which extends the `AbstractDatabase` to provide
methods for interacting with WhatsApp's SQLite databases. It facilitates the retrieval of
various data types, including:

- **Chats**: Fetches both individual and group chats with relevant details such as user
  information, last message content, and timestamps.

- **Messages**: Retrieves messages associated with a specific chat, including text data,
  media file paths, and quoted message details.

- **Calls**: Obtains call logs with information on call direction, type (video or audio),
  duration, and associated user details.

The `Database` class constructs SQL queries to extract this information, ensuring that the
retrieved data is organized and accessible for further processing or analysis.

Classes:
    Database: Extends `AbstractDatabase` to implement methods for fetching chats, messages,
              and call logs from WhatsApp's databases.
